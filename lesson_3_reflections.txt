When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

working on project with multiple contributors
using multiple computers to complete work
want your progress to be visible to the public

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

manually pulling changes will allow users to only pull when they want to. if there are multiple contributors, it allows for separation of work.
