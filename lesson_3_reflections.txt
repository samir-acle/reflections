When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

working on project with multiple contributors
using multiple computers to complete work
want your progress to be visible to the public

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

manually pulling changes will allow users to only pull when they want to. if there are multiple contributors, it allows for separation of work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks - clone repositories on github
clones - copy repositories from github to local computer or copy from local to local
branches - within repositories

use fork to propose code changes (fix bugs) to an already exisiting repository, or use one as a starting point for a new project

use clones on github repository to make local changes, then push and pull to remote

use branches when making experimental changes on exisitng code to ensure still have
fully functioning code in case you break anything

this is a test
