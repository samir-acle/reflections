What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

when you initialize a repository you are creating a .git directory which will store all the meta
data from previous versions/commits.  This needs to be done so there is a place for your commits
to go.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area is a place to store files that are ready to committed.  it is different from the wd, which stores
all files- those tracked and those not.  it precedes the repository which holds the snapshots of the states of files
tracked - once the user decides to commit them.  It offers value in that you can start adding files to the staging area
once they are ready to be commited, while you work on others which you want included in the commit.  it allows for more
flexibility in when you choose to commit and better organization of which files are ready by using git status.
